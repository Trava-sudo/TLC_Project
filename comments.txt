I was not able to tackle the bonus tasks with enough time. I thought about adding to the database a table with the weather conditions day by day, maybe making one table for each year, so that one could make predictions on future behaviours based on the relation between TLC data and weather data in the past years.

For what concern xlsx format and workspace, I am not an expert on using Excel for data pipelines, so I would firstly ask myself if I can manage this amount of data through excel or that would be too heavy on the software: there are some files that can reach 1.5+ GB and have milions of entries.

From the result delivered you can certainly guess I am not very knowledgable in terms of tools for data pipelines, or so I would think: I am sure some problems I had with importing the data and creating tables into a database would be much easier with some softwares I am, for now, not aware of. I briefly saw that AWS has many packages useful for data pipelines and such, but I preferred to make something finished that worked, instead of starting to learn a new tool with the risk of not being able to deliver before the due date.

Also working with a local machine I feel I was limited by the power of the hardware, and so I would say in another situation I would have created a single table for each year, keeping separated the different kind of vehicles, so that I could then run queries directly in MySQL without making convoluted python scripts.

For what concerns the different kinds of vehicles and the possibility of merging green and yellow taxis I would keep them separated because the columns also differ, so the type of data registered is different, and going back it change even for the same kind of vehicle it seems, so I would keep that divided of maybe united yellow with yellow data from two different times (ie. 2014 and 2019) create through SQL queries new columns for the table referring to the past where it lacks data, and filling them with values corresponding to null or 0 depending on the columns type.
